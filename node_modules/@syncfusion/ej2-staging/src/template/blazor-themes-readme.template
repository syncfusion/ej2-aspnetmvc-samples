# blazor-themes

The Blazor Themes package contains SCSS files for all themes supported by Syncfusion Blazor components. These SCSS files customize theme variables using a web compiler. The package includes component SCSS files and single SCSS files.

## Setup

Use the following command to install.

```sh
npm install @syncfusion/blazor-themes
```

## Usage

You can reference themes or customize themes for Syncfusion Blazor components in Blazor applications. Follow these steps to customize a theme:

1. After installing the package, create a SCSS file in the Static Web Assets folder (e.g., `~/wwwroot/styles/custom.scss`). Next, define the [theme variables](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/theme-studio#common-variables) to override and import the theme as shown in the following.

    In the following code, the primary theme variable color is changed.
    For all components:

    ```scss
    $primary: blue !default;
    @import 'blazor-themes/SCSS-Themes/fluent.scss';
    ```

    For the Calendar (individual) component:

    ```scss
    $primary: blue !default;
    @import 'blazor-themes/SCSS-Themes/calendars/calendar/fluent.scss';
    ```

2. Compile the SCSS file to a CSS file using [Visual Studio Web Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebCompiler) or any other extension and add the compiled CSS file to the `<head>` element of the Host page.

```cshtml
<head>
    ...
    ...
    <link href="~/styles/custom.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

3. Run the application to see the customized Fluent theme applied.
